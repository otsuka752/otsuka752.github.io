<h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
*tcpcapinfo was born out of a need for me to diagnose tcprewrite bugs and broken pcap files. 
Honestly, it's usefulness is probably limited only to people who code applications which 
read/write pcap files, but I include it with the Tcpreplay Suite for completeness. 
*tcpcapinfo* was first released in version 3.4.5.

<h2><a name="basic-usage"></a>Basic Usage</h2>

```
$ tcpcapinfo file.pcap
```

Will process file.pcap and report information about the libpcap packet/file headers, 
a packet checksum and some basic sanity checks such as if the packet is too 
large given the pcap file's snaplen header value or if the timestamp goes backwards in time. 
Note that the "packet checksum" is not the same thing as the IP checksum, 
and is intended to provide a means if two Ethernet frames are the same.
