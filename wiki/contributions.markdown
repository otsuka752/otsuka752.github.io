Tcpreplay is authored by Aaron Turner(@synfinatic). In 2013 Fred Klassen (@fklassen),
Co-founder and VP Advanced Technology, [AppNeta Inc.](http://appneta.com) added performance 
features and enhancements, and ultimately took over the maintenance of Tcpreplay. For more
information see [the history of Tcpreplay][history].

The source code repository has moved to GitHub. You can get a working copy of the repository by 
installing **git** and executing:

```
git clone git@github.com:appneta/tcpreplay.git
```

## How To Contribute

It's easy. Basically you...

* [Set up git][git]
* [Fork]
* Edit (we that you create a branch per issue)
* [Send a PR][pr]

### Details:

You will find that you will not be able to contribute to the Tcpreplay project directly if you
use clone the appneta/tcpreplay repo. If you believe that you may someday contribute to the
repository, GitHub provides an innovative approach. Forking the @appneta/tcpreplay repository
allows you to work on your own copy of the repository and submit code changes without first
asking permission from the authors. Forking is also considered to be a compliment so fork away:
   
* if you haven't already done so, get yourself a free [GitHub](https://github.com) ID and visit @appneta/tcpreplay
* click the **Fork** button to get your own private copy of the repository
* on your build system clone your private repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:<your ID>/tcpreplay.git
```

* we like to keep the **master** branch available for projection ready code so we recommend that you make a branch for
each feature or bug fix
* when you are happy with your work, push it to your GitHub repository
* on your GitHub repository select your new branch and submit a **Pull Request** to **master**
* optionally monitor the status of your submission [here](https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay/network)

We will review and possibly discuss the changes with you through GitHub services. 
If we accept the submission, it will instantly be applied to the production **master** branch.
