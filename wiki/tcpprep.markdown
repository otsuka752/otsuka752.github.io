<h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
*tcpprep* is the pcap pre-processor for [tcpreplay] and [tcprewrite]. 
The purpose of *tcpprep* is to create a cache file which is used to "split" traffic
into two sides (often called primary/secondary or client/server). If you are intending to 
use tcpreplay with two NIC's, then tcpprep is what decides which interface each packet will use. 
By using a separate process to generate cache files, tcpreplay can send packets at a much higher 
rate then if it had to do the calculations to split traffic itself.

<h2><a name="details"></a>Details</h2>
Depending on the contents of the pcap and where you are replaying, you will want to 
split traffic differently. The most important thing to remember, is that you want to 
make sure that the device(s) under test (DUT) between the two NIC's see the traffic 
so that a client connecting to a server will go through the DUT one way, and the responses 
will go through the DUT the other way.

<h2><a name="basic-usage"></a>Basic Usage</h2>
*tcpprep* supports multiple "modes" of operation. Each mode uses different logic to split 
traffic differently. For example, if you want to pass traffic through a router, then router 
mode is probably best, if you're testing a bridge or other Layer 2 device then bridge mode 
may work better. The following modes are currently available:

* Auto/Bridge
* Auto/Router
* Auto/Client
* Auto/Server
* IPv4/v6 matching CIDR
* IPv4/v6 matching Regex
* TCP/UDP Port
*MAC address

Note the Auto modes do not yet 
support IPv6. As with tcprewrite IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in hard brackets 
like this: [2001::dead:beef]

<h3><a name="autobridge"></a>Auto/Bridge</h3>
In Auto/Bridge mode, *tcpprep* parses the pcap file and keeps track each time a host 
either behaves like a client or like a server. Currently client behavior is defined by:   
* Sending a TCP Syn packet to another host
* Making a DNS request
* Recieving an ICMP port unreachable

Server behavior is defined by:   
* Sending a TCP Syn/Ack packet to another host
* Sending a DNS Reply
* Sending an ICMP port unreachable

After all the packets have been processed, the totals for client-like behavior vs. server-like 
behavior are totalled and the server to client ratio (`--ratio`) is applied to 
classify each IP. If there is any IP address which is unclassifiable, then *tcpprep*
will fail with an error. By default the client/server ratio is set to 2.0. 
The ratio is the modifier to the number of client connections. 
Hence, by default, client connections are valued twice as high as server connections.

```
$ tcpprep --auto=bridge --pcap=input.pcap --cachefile=input.cache
```

If you want to change the client/server ratio then use the --ratio option:

```
$ tcpprep --auto=bridge --pcap=input.pcap --cachefile=input.cache --ratio=3.5
```

Note: The --ratio option is valid for all automatic processing modes.

<h2><a name="autorouter"></a>Auto/Router</h2>
In Auto/Router mode hosts are first ranked as client or server using the same method as in Auto/Bridge mode. Then each host is placed in a small subnet which is expanded until either all the unknown hosts are included or the maximum newtork size is reached. This works best when clients and servers are on diffierent networks. The default starting network size is a /30 (2 valid IP addresses) and the maximum network is a /8 (Class A with over 16 million addresses). The following images hopefully better explain this process:

1. First each host is categorized as a client or server as best as possible,
but sometimes one or more hosts are unclassifyable (denoted by ?)   
![router1][router1]


2. Each known host is placed in a subnet which is grown until all the unknown 
hosts are inside one of these subnets    
![router2][router2]

3. Unknown hosts are classified in the same category (server or client) based on which 
subnet they were in.  
![router3][router3]

```
$ tcpprep --auto=router --pcap=input.pcap --cachefile=input.cache
```

*tcpprep* also allows you to override the starting and maximum nework size using the --minmask and --maxmask arguments.

```
$ tcpprep --minmask=24 --maxmask=16 --auto=router --pcap=input.pcap --cachefile=input.cache
```

Would start searching using a Class C network and max out with a Class B network.

<h3><a name="autoclient"></a>Auto/Client</h3>
Auto/Client mode works just like Auto/Bridge mode, but IP addresses which have not been classified as either client or server after the initial ranking are classified as clients.

```
$ tcpprep --auto=client --pcap=input.pcap --cachefile=input.cache
```

<h2><a name="autoserver"></a>Auto/Server</h2>
Auto/Server mode works just like Auto/Bridge mode, but IP addresses which have not been
classified as either client or server after the initial ranking are classified as servers.

```
$ tcpprep --auto=server --pcap=input.pcap --cachefile=input.cache
```

<h3><a name="cidr"></a>CIDR</h3>
CIDR mode unlike the Auto/* modes does not use any automatic ranking system to classify
IP addresses. Instead, it requires the user to specify on or more networks in CIDR notation
which contain servers.

```
$ tcpprep --cidr=10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12 --pcap=input.pcap --cachefile=input.cache
```

<h3><a name="regex"></a>Regex</h3>
Regex mode works like CIDR mode, except that instead of providing a list of CIDR's, 
the user provides a regex which matches the source IP of the servers. In this case any 
IP starting with 10. or 20.

```
$ tcpprep --regex="(10|20)\..*" --pcap=input.pcap --cachefile=input.cache
```

<h3><a name="port"></a>Port</h3>

Port mode is used when you want to use the source and destination port of TCP/UDP packets
to classify hosts as client or server. Normally, ports 0-1023 are
considered server ports and everything else a client port. You can create your
own custom mapping file in the same format as /etc/services (see the services(5) 
man page for details) by specifying --services <file>.

```
$ tcpprep --port --services=/etc/services --pcap=input.pcap --cachefile=input.cache
```

<h3><a name="mac"></a>MAC</h3>

MAC address mode is used when you want to split traffic based on the source MAC address 
of the Ethernet header. Frames with a source address matching one of the listed MAC 
addresses will be treated as a server. Multiple MAC addresses can be provided in a
comma delimited format.

```
$ tcpprep --mac=00:21:00:55:23:AF,00:45:90:E0:CF:A2 --pcap=input.pcap --cachefile=input.cache
```

<h3><a name="skip-packets"></a>Skip Packets</h3>

Instead of marking a packet as client/server, it can also mark the packet to be skipped
when processed by *tcpreplay* and *tcprewrite*. Skipped packets are not sent by *tcpreplay*
and not edited by tcprewrite. By default, all packets are processed and none of them 
are skipped. Include and Exclude filters support IPv6 addresses.

<h3><a name="include"></a>Include</h3>

Change the default to be skip and only process packets which match the --include flag.

```

<h4><a name="destination-ip-negative-match"></a>Destination IP Negative Match</h4>

Only process packets which don't match the destination IP in the networks:

```

<h2><a name="other-options"></a>Other Options</h2>

<h3><a name="comments"></a>Comments</h3>

*tcpprep* allows you to embed comments in your cache file which you can then read at a
later time. tcpprep also saves what the commands line arguments were when the cache file
was generated. To save a comment, use the `--comment` flag. To read the comment, 
use the `--print-comment` flag:

```
$ tcpprep <args> --pcap=input.pcap --cachefile=input.cache --comment="This is our evil packet pcap"

$ tcpprep --print-comment=input.cache
```

<h3><a name="detailed-info"></a>Detailed Info</h3>

*tcpprep* also allows you to view statistical information as well as detailed per-packet data.

To view the overall statistical info, use the `--print-stats` flag:

```
$ tcpprep --print-stats=input.cache
```

To view per-packet data, use the --print-info flag:

```
$ tcpprep --print-info=input.cache
```

<h2><a name="non-ip-traffic"></a>Non-IP Traffic</h4>
Many of tcpprep's modes rely on IP address information in the IPv4 header to
determine whether the packet was sent by a "client" or "server". Of course, not all
network packets are IPv4 and hence tcpprep in those cases has no way to determine which
direction the packet is going. Hence, by default, *tcpprep* will send all non-IPv4 traffic
out the client/secondary interface. You can change this to be the server/primary interface
by using the `--nonip` flag. If of course you need to split non-IP traffic, then you should
use the MAC address mode (`--mac`).
