### Pcap file editors and utilities:
* [tcpprep]({{ site.url }}tcpprep.html) - multi-pass pcap file pre-processor which determines packets as client or server and splits them into output files for use by tcpreplay and tcprewrite
* [tcprewrite]({{ site.url }}tcprewrite.html) - pcap file editor which rewrites TCP/IP and Layer 2 packet headers
* [tcpcapinfo]({{ site.url }}tcpcapinfo.html) - raw pcap file decoder and debugger
