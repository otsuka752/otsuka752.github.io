* [Complete list of past releases][old_stuff]

### <a name="download-source"></a>Download Source for Developers
Compiling source from [GitHub][repo] has more requirements than compiling a release.
Specifically you must have [AutoGen][autogen] installed. If you plan to contribute you must
have [AutoGen version 5.16.2][autogen-download], otherwise your [pull requests][pullreq]
may be rejected.

If you want to help develop Tcpreplay visit our [Developer Wiki][dev-wiki].

* Download via [GitHub][repo]
 - `git clone https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay`
* Or if you plan to contribute someday simply [fork][fork] the [repo][repo] and submit a [pull request][pullreq] when
you are ready to share your changes with us
* Or download the latest [master tarball][tarball]
* Note that *master* is always production ready, but not necessarily the latest stable release. See [GitHub network][network]
to see the state of master

<h2 id="Installation"><a name="installation"></a>Installation</h2>

### <a name="simple-directions-for-unix-users"></a>Simple directions for Unix users
You will need to compile the source code, but first you must ensure that you have
compiling tools and prerequisite software installed. For example, on a base 
Ubuntu or Debian system you may need to do the following:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libpcap-dev
```  

Next extract tarball, change to root directory, then do:


```
./configure 
make
sudo make install
```

Optionally you can run the tests to ensure that your installation is
fully functional:

```
sudo make test
```

### <a name="build-netmap-feature"></a>Build netmap feature
This feature will detect [netmap][nm]
capable network drivers on Linux and BSD 
systems. If detected, the network driver is bypassed for the execution 
duration of tcpreplay and tcpreplay-edit, and network buffers will be 
written to directly. This will allow you to achieve full line rates on 
commodity network adapters, similar to rates achieved by commercial network 
traffic generators.

**Note** that bypassing the network driver will disrupt other applications
connected through the test interface. For example, you may see interruptions
while testing on the same interface you ssh'ed into.

FreeBSD 10 and higher already contains netmap capabilities and will be detected
by *configure*. To enable netmap on the system you will need to 
recompile the kernel with *device netmap* included.

For Linux, download latest and install netmap from <http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/>
If you extracted netmap into */usr/src/* or */usr/local/src* you can build without extra
*configure* options. Otherwise you will must specify the netmap source directory, for example:

```
./configure --with-netmap=/home/fklassen/git/netmap
make
sudo make install
```

You can also find netmap source at <http://code.google.com/p/netmap/>

## <a name="advanced-options"></a>Advanced Options

There are quite a few configure time options for tcpreplay which allow you to control a lot
of things. Some of the more interesting ones are:

* *--enable-debug* -- useful for debugging bugs and crashes.
* *--enable-64bits* -- use 64 bit counters to handle large pcap files & looping
* *--enable-libnet* -- link to libnet. Note that libnet support has been deprecated due to
various bugs which have not been fixed in over a year.
* *--with-libnet* -- specify root path to libnet (something like --with-libnet=/usr/local)
* *--with-libpcap* -- specify root path to libpcap
* *--with-netmap* -- specify root path to netmap
* *--with-tcpdump* -- specify path to tcpdump executable
* *--enable-tcpreplay-edit* -- compile tcpreplay with packet editing support

You can also manually select a particular method to inject packets:

* *--enable-force-pf* -- force tcpreplay to use Linux's PF_PACKET to send packets
* *--enable-force-bpf* -- force tcpreplay to use Free/Net?/OpenBSD or OS X's BPF interface
to send packets
* *--enable-force-libnet* -- force tcpreplay to use Libnet to send packets
* *--enable-force-inject* -- force tcpreplay to use Libpcap's pcap_inject() API to send packets
* *--enable-force-sendpacket* -- force tcpreplay to use Libpcap's pcap_sendpacket() API
to send packets

If you're having compatibility issues with a system-installed GNU Autogen, 
you may want to consider these options:

* *--disable-local-libopts* -- Don't use the libopts tearoff supplied with tcpreplay 
(default is enabled)
* *--disable-libopts-install* -- don't install the libopts library files

## <a name="special-instructions-for-windows"></a>Special Instructions for Windows

Consider Windows support for Tcpreplay is experimental - beta quality if you will.
We strongly recommend you read the page about [how to get support for Tcpreplay][Support].

With that said, you'll need [Cygwin] to compile/run tcpreplay. You'll also need to install 
[Winpcap] - the port of libpcap for Windows. For whatever reason, it seems important 
that you install the Winpcap files in the Cygwin root directory (/Wpdpack).

Be sure to install both the [driver and DLL][dll] files AND [developer pack][devpack]. 
Then when you run 
./configure, you'll need to specify the location for Winpcap using the `--with-libpcap` 
flag, but use all lowercase: `./configure --with-libpcap=/wpdpack`.

After that, for the most part things should just work. There are some caveats; a few 
features and `make test` don't work, but for the most part they seem to be pretty minor.

For more detailed instructions, see the [Win32Readme.txt].

Note: We've been informed that the guile Cygwin package is broken.
This horribly breaks parts of GNU Autogen - specifically the parts which
allow you to build Tcpreplay via GitHub. Hence, I strongly recommend grabbing 
a tarball release.
