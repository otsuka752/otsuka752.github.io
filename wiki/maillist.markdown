Tcpreplay has a mailing list for it's users. However, before posting a question, 
please read the short [README] included with the latest source. It explains what
information is needed to answer many tcpreplay related questions. You'd be amazed
how many people don't even say which version of Tcpreplay they are using!

So now that you've read the README (you did read it right?) feel free to 
[sign up][signup] or [read the list archives][archives].

There is also a mailing list for people interested in [Tcpreplay development][devlist].

If you are reporting a bug please submit it on [GitHub Issues][bugs].
