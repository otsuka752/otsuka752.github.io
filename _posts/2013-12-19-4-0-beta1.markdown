Today we are announcing the beta launch of the newly expanded capabilities of the Tcpreplay suite,
expanding capabilities and increasing performance. Version [4.0.0 Beta 1][downloads] brings many new features and
bug fixes:

* 10GigE wire-speed replay rates when using [netmap](http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/) network drivers   
* [IP Flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_flow_%28computer_networking%29) statistics  
* Near-zero overhead option for generating unique flows every loop iteration
* High accuracy, high performance --mbps option
* Pseudo-CRC to avoid CRC recalculations and improve performance tcpreplay-edit
* API for other Open Source projects
* Deprecation of redundant and obsolete options
* ARM and PPC support including cross-compile support
* Overhaul of timestamp methodology in main TX loop to maximize performance
* Switch from BSD to GPLv3 license

*Examples:*

Here is an example output of tcpreplay illustrating 10GigE near wire speed and 157K flows/sec.

```
# tcpreplay --preload-pcap -i eth0 --loop 500 -t --unique-ip --netmap smallFlows.pcap 
Switching network driver for eth0 to netmap bypass mode... done!
File Cache is enabled
Actual: 7130500 packets (4608265500 bytes) sent in 3.08 seconds.
Rated: 1197981408.4 Bps, 9583.85 Mbps, 1853670.63 pps
Flows: 604500 flows, 157148.01 fps, 7121500 flow packets, 9000 non-flow
Statistics for network device: eth0
	Attempted packets: 7130500
	Successful packets: 7130500
	Failed packets: 0
	Truncated packets: 0
	Retried packets (ENOBUFS): 0
	Retried packets (EAGAIN): 0
Switching network driver for eth0 to normal mode... done!
```

Note that the above example is closer to wire speed than it first appears. Average packet size
for this pcap file is (4608265500 รท 7130500) = 646 bytes. 10GigE Ethernet will add an 
additional 17 bytes for IFG, preamble, SOF and FCS which makes the the average frame 
size on the wire equal to 663. On wire speed is (663 รท 646) ร 9582.85 = 9836 Mbps. 

The next example is the same except limited to 9500Mbps...

```
# tcpreplay --preload-pcap -i eth0 -l 500 -M 9500 --unique-ip --netmap smallFlows.pcap 
Switching network driver for eth0 to netmap bypass mode... done!

Flows: 604500 flows, 155772.91 fps, 7121500 flow packets, 9000 non-flow

	Truncated packets:         0
	Retried packets (ENOBUFS): 0
	Retried packets (EAGAIN):  0
Switching network driver for eth0 to normal mode... done!
```

When using pcap files with tiny packets, full wire rate is not achieved. The limiting
factor is the flows per second (fps). Notice that in the following example we achieve 1.8 million
fps and our packets per second (pps) rate has jumped dramatically.

```
# tcpreplay --preload-pcap -i eth0 -l50000 -t --unique-ip --netmap tiny-packets.pcap 
Switching network driver for eth0 to netmap bypass mode... done!
