After over a dozen years of commitment and devotion, the author of Tcpreplay, Aaron Turner, 
announces a new maintainer for one of his most demanding Open Source projects. Effective 
immediately, Fred Klassen, Co-founder and VP Advanced Technology, AppNeta Inc. will be taking
on the maintainer role for Tcpreplay. Fred brings with him the AppNeta engineering team, 
which includes developers, QA and support staff.

Fred has over 30 years experience in many aspects of networking and application
performance. He is as comfortable tackling some of the world's most challenging performance
issues as he is improving network drivers. He has worked on-site at over 100 corporate companies
and has taught over 1000 IT specialists the art of performance troubleshooting. Fred holds
several patents, and is the inventor of several end-to-end network performance algorithms 
found in his company's PathView product.

Aaron Turner will be taking a less active role with Tcpreplay, but will continue to offer
guidance and support for Fred and his team.
