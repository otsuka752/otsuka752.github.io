Today we are releasing Tcpreplay suite version [4.0.0 Beta 2][downloads]. Many thanks to
the early support received from the Tcpreplay community to help identify and
resolve some bugs. Here's what's new:

- Restored -K option which somehow disappeared (appneta #35)
- Improve printing with small pcaps at high rates (appneta #34)
- Fixed build errors on BSD and Fedora 20 (appneta #32 #33)

Visit our [downloads][] page to get it.
