Hi Everyone,

I'm excited to announce that I've agreed to hand off the role of
maintainer of Tcpreplay to Fred Klassen of AppNeta.  Fred came to me
with a laundry list of patches and significant enhancements that he
had developed for improving Tcpreplay.  After some soul searching of
my own and talking it over with Fred, I came to the conclusion that
Fred and AppNeta will be better able to provide the time and effort to
improve Tcpreplay then I am able to going forward.   While this was a
difficult decision, I've realized that I don't have the same level of
interest or free time to devote to continue to improve Tcpreplay as I
once did.  Back in 2001 when I started working on Tcpreplay I was very
active in the network security space and being able to generate
traffic for testing network gear was important to me.  But over time
my career has evolved and I'm no longer doing this kind of testing and
so my interest in the project has waned.


Choosing Fred as the new maintainer was a far easier decision- Fred is
a capable developer, familiar with the code and both he and AppNeta
have a vested interest in seeing Tcpreplay continue to thrive and
improve.  I'm sure all of you will share my excitement once you see
what Fred has in store for Tcpreplay!  While I am stepping down as the
official maintainer, I'm not completely leaving the Tcpreplay
community and will continue to provide guidance and advice for the
project and probably the occasional code/documentation enhancement.


With Fred taking over the reins, there are some changes in the works
including a new official website, GitHub repository and an upcoming
release with lots of interesting enhancements which I'm sure will make
many of you very happy.  But perhaps one of the most important changes
that Fred and AppNeta have agreed to is that all future releases of
Tcpreplay will be under the GPLv3 license.  This will guarantee that
Tcpreplay continues to be Open Source and available free of charge to
everyone.


Fred will be introducing himself to the list shortly.  I hope some of
you will take a moment to reach out and say hi and introduce yourself.
I'm sure he'd love to hear any feature requests or bugs you might be
currently seeing. :)


Regards,
Aaron
