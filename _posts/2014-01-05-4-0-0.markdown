---

Today we are announcing the launch of the newly expanded capabilities of the Tcpreplay suite,
expanding capabilities and increasing performance. 
Please visit our [downloads] page to get it.

Version 4.0.0 brings many new features and
bug fixes:

* 10GigE wire-speed replay rates when using [netmap](http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/) network drivers   
* [IP Flow][flow]/[NetFlow] support  
* Near-zero overhead option for generating unique flows every loop iteration
* High accuracy, high performance --mbps option
* Overhaul of timestamp methodology in main TX loop to maximize performance
* API for other Open Source projects
* Deprecation of redundant and obsolete options
* ARM and PPC support including cross-compile support
* Juniper Encapsulated Ethernet DLT and PPP Serial DLT support
* Switch from BSD to GPLv3 license

*Examples:*

Here is an example output of tcpreplay illustrating 10GigE near wire speed and 157K flows/sec.

Note that the above example is closer to wire speed than it first appears. Average packet size
for this pcap file is (4608265500 รท 7130500) = 646 bytes. 10GigE Ethernet will add an 
additional 17 bytes for IFG, preamble, SOF and FCS which makes the the average frame 
size on the wire equal to 663. On wire speed is (663 รท 646) ร 9582.85 = 9836 Mbps. 

The next example is the same except limited to 9500Mbps...

When using pcap files with tiny packets, full wire rate is not achieved. The limiting
factor is the flows per second (fps). Notice that in the following example we achieve 1.8 million
fps and our packets per second (pps) rate has jumped dramatically.
